# 6 Mistakes Beginner Web Developers Make And How To Avoid Them

1. Relying on jQuery

Don't rely on jQuery. Instead learn JavaScript like "the back of your hand". Read Kyle Simpson's books to learn the ins and outs of JavaScript (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

2. Relying on JS Frameworks

 Instead of jumping right into one of the JS frameworks, build a strong foundation of JavaScript. Doing this will help with technical interviews. In addition, having a strong foundation will allow for an easier transition into one of the JS frameworks. 

3. Using Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a UI framework that may make sites easier to make but that's the only good thing about it. Relying on Bootstrap is hinderance that will show employers a lack of knowledge about performance and CSS basics. Employers would rather see knowledge of CSS than any UI framework. Instead of using a UI framework like Bootstrap, use CSS Flexbox and Grid. CSS Flexbox and Grid will allow for a more responsive layout. Learn the fundamentals and then learn Sass. 

4. Not Modularizing Your Code

It’s extremely important to ensure your code is modular; do not put it all into one HTML file. Not only is it bad practice to have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one file, it’s messy and difficult to test.

**Recommendation:** Break your JavaScript into an external file. This allows . you to separate functionality from your view. Once you feel comfortable with JavaScript, I recommend learning about [native web components](https://codeburst.io/6-reasons-you-should-use-native-web-components-b45e18e069c2). It will greatly enhance your project architecture and make it easier to write unit tests. You can additionally consider a JavaScript framework or library like [React](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/building-a-recipe-book-in-react-part-1-c05b3e53cbb1) or Vue. Both of these make it very easy to implement modular components, however be sure to understand vanilla JavaScript before tackling one of these!

5. Not Using Semantic HTML

One thing I often see when reviewing candidates’ portfolios and projects is the over-use of `<div>` and `<span>`. You should **always** be using semantic HTML5 elements. Why? Because it’s accessible.

**Recommendation:** Really get to know the semantic elements you have available to you. Learn how to create a markup hierarchy. Additionally, learning about [web accessibility](https://codeburst.io/seven-ways-to-make-your-web-app-more-accessible-411a8c716fcb) is a great skill and can impress potential employers.

6. Not Learning Responsive Design

If you’re beginning your web development journey, responsive design skills are a must. The majority of web surfing is done on mobile devices and tablets, thus our sites must be able to respond to different screen sizes.

**Recommendation:** Take a course or two on responsive design. Learn how to use media queries to style your application differently. Learning [Flexbox and CSS Grid](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/when-to-use-css-flexbox-vs-grid-or-both-c1a5f01dc88a) will also be very useful. You might even want to take a [mobile-first](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mobile-first-responsive-web-design?gclid=CjwKCAjwq57cBRBYEiwAdpx0vXWVWneBbyRUooDlu1nEAIgDdVCiRVVkQkoNp9aOUahLUQRywOulRxoCS0kQAvD_BwE&aid=7010a000002BWqGAAW&promo=&oid=&utm_source=non_branded&utm_medium=digital_paid_search_google&utm_campaign=EMEA_Dynamic&utm_content=&s_kwcid=AL!5668!3!277727473382!b!!g!!&ef_id=WwQn1AAAAMIlu2jc:20180830171925:s)approach.
